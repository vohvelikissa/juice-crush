# juice-crush
candy crush clone with a Juice Leskinen twist

# Why am I doing this?
For fun mostly. This kind of project quite literally cannot be for profit.

# TODO list
- [ ] create/use some kind of datastructure for storing and handling the infinite level/map
- [ ] create a function for initially filling the infinite (in actuality 8x8) map
- [ ] create a function for handling the destruction of the juice candies
- [ ] create a function for handling the refilling of the infinite map
- [ ] find out what is needed to create a window with SDL
- [ ] create a function that updates the candies drawn on the screen based on the grid
- [ ] create a function that handles the mouse clicks on the grid positions
- [ ] create a function that handles the destruction of juice candies based on the clicks
- [ ] play some music in the background with some kind of a function
